# **LPR_18**

Automatic License plate recognition could be used to
automatically open a gate or barrier into a secured area for authorised members, and actually log all vehicles allowed into the premises and thos that have already left the premises. 

In the event of a stolen vehicle automatic LPR, could actually save the day where such a vehicle can be marked as stolen and if it happens to pass the IoT device running this model the system will actually trigger an alarm.

The system is also helpful in  Traffic flow management
